## What This Project Does (In Simple Terms)

Imagine you want to buy headphones online. Instead of visiting Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart separately to compare prices, this system does it all for you automatically! 

**Here's the magic:** It uses **Artificial Intelligence** to "look" at websites just like a human would, extract product information, and show you all the prices in one place - sorted from cheapest to most expensive.
## Why This Is Special

### Traditional Way (Boring & Breaks Often):
- Websites change their design → price scrapers break
- Need to write different code for each website
- Requires constant maintenance when sites update

### Our AI Way (Smart & Future-Proof):
- **AI Vision** looks at websites like human eyes
- **Works on ANY website** - no special coding needed
- **Adapts automatically** when websites change their design
- **Never breaks** because it understands visually, not through code

## Perfect for Emma Robot Job Application
